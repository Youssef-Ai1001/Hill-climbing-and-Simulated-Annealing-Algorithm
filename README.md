# Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing

This repository contains implementations and examples of two popular AI search algorithms: **Hill Climbing** and **Simulated Annealing**. These algorithms are used for optimization problems where the goal is to find the best solution from a large set of possible solutions.

## Contents

- **Hill Climbing**: A local search algorithm that iteratively moves towards a better solution by evaluating neighboring states.
- **Simulated Annealing**: A probabilistic technique that explores the solution space by allowing occasional moves to worse solutions to escape local optima.
